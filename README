I talked about the exercise with Guy Katz, Yair Shemer, and Itay Tayar.


I built a program that accepts files that contain a letter matrix,
a list of words and search directions, and prints to a file several
times the words appear according to the search directions.

The assignment to functions was based on the following understanding:
I tried to see within the various search directions,
actions that repeat several times.
I found that the directions: up-down, right-left, diagonal from the top
and bottom, and diagonal to the left from the top and bottom-
are the same in the opposite direction.
Besides, I found that the search in columns and rows are the same
when replacing the rows with the columns.
And the two diagonals is the same activity in reverse the order of rows.

Therefore, I written one function that all search directions will lead to,
that searches for all the words in a given list, using some auxiliary functions

I wrote a function that scans by line (in the normal and inverse direction),
and the function that transpose the matrix.
That's how I handled all the straight lines.

A function that is scanned by diagonals (in the normal and inverse direction),
and a function that turns the rows of the matrix.
That's how I treated all the diagonals.



Explanation of the test file-
I checked the word_in_line function

I chose different types of inputs -
A word that appears once, does not appear at all, appears several times,
either individually or in combination (one or more letters shared).
Also, different combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters.
